# About This Project

This project is API ready application, current is getting mock data from src folder. 

It is inspired by other developer, and I myself decided to develop the application with only frontend of the application. 

This project is mainly for practise frontend development skill and data manipulation purposes. To save time on develop backend, mock up data allow the frontend to perform it main function without the hassle of backend development.

So, feel free to take the source code.
